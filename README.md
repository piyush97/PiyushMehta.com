## ðŸš€ Get Up and Running

You can get a site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:

1. **Install Dependencies.**

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

   Next, move into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up:

   ```shell
   cd PiyushMehta.com
   gatsby develop
   ```

4. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `PiyushMehta.com` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, youâ€™ve got a fully functional website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.com/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).
