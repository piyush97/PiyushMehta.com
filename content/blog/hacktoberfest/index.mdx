Hacktoberfest 2020 is a month long virtual festival event to celebrate open source contributions presented by Digital Ocean, Intel and DEV. It is the easiest way to get into open source!

## Do you know what is Open Source?

- Open-source software is software that is freely available to use, redistribute,
  and modify. Projects that are open source encourage a transparent process that is
  advanced through distributed peer review. Open-source projects can be updated quickly
  and as needed, and offer reliable and flexible software that is not built on locked
  proprietary systems.

* The best way to begin to contribute to open-source projects is to start by contributing
  to software that you already use. As a user of a particular tool, you best understand
  what functionalities would be most valuable to the project. Make sure you read any
  available documentation about the software first. In fact, many open-source projects
  will have a CONTRIBUTING.md file in the root directory, which you should read carefully
  before you contribute. You may also want to get a sense of the interactions between
  other developers in the community if there are forums about the project available.

Finally, if you’re just starting out with contributing to open-source software,
it is a good idea to start with something small — each contribution is valuable.
You may want to start with fixing typos, adding comments, or writing clearer documentation.

## Lets check if you have Git Installed

You can check whether Git is installed and what version you are using by opening up a terminal window in Linux or Mac, or a command prompt window in Windows, and typing the following command:

```bash
git version
```

However, if Git is not installed, you will receive an error similar to the following:

```bash
-bash: git: command not found
```

````bash
'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.```
````

In this case, you should install Git into your machine first <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"> Install Git Guide </a>
