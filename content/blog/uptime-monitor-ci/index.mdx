Create your own website monitor in seconds!

### Step 1

Create a new repository, I'll name is piyushmehta.com

### Step 2

Create a directory named and workflows inside it `.github/workflows`

### Step 3

Create a file with any name, I'll name is `uptime-monitor.yml`

### Step 4

Write the following in uptime-monitor.yaml

```yml
name: Uptime Monitor

on:
  schedule:
    # Run every hour, You can choose your custom time
    - cron: '*/60 *  * * *'

jobs:
  ping_site:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Uptime Check
    steps:
      - name: Ping Site
        uses: srt32/uptime@v0.2
        with:
          url-to-hit: 'https://piyushmehta.com/' # Website whose uptime you want to track
          expected-statuses: '200'
```

> Whenever your website is down, you'll get a notification from GitHub.

Fin!
